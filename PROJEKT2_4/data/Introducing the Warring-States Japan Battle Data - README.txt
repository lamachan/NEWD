Thank you for your interest in the Warring-States Japan Battle data. Everything necessary to replicate the results in the 
article and to make use of the data is included in the supplemental material. 

The files included in the supplemental material are:

1. WarringStatesJapan_battledataV1.csv -- This is the data set introduced in the article, covering all battles occuring in Japan 
   during its Warring-States period, 1467-1600.

2. WarringStatesJapan_diffusiondata_monadic.csv -- This is the data used for the monadic diffusion analysis in the article.

3. WarringStatesJapan_diffusiondata_dyadic.csv -- This is the data used for the dyadic diffusion analysis in the article. 

4. Introducing the Warring-States Japan Battle Data - Online Appendix.pdf -- This is the online appendix that accompanies
   the article.

5. Introducing the Warring-States Japan Battle Data - Data Analysis Replication File.R -- This is the R code needed to
   replicate the results of the analysis presented in the article and the online appendix.

6. Introducing the Warring-States Japan Battle Data - Figure Replication File.R -- This is the R code needed to recreate
   the descriptive statistics figures presented in the article and the online appendix.

7. Introducing the Warring-States Japan Battle Data - Figures.xlsx -- This file contains the figures presented in the 
   article and appendix as well as the underlying data used to produce them.

To replicate the results of the analysis presented in the article and appendix, you'll need items 1, 2, 3, and 5.

Save files 1, 2, and 3 on your hard drive and then use the R code in file 5 to run the analysis.

To recreate the figures presented in the article and appendix, you'll need items 1, 2, and 6.

Save files 1 and 2 on your hard drive and then use the R code in file 6 to create the figures (though note that I also 
include the figures as item 7).
